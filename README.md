# The R&M Characters List
A [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) project that consumes public API provided by [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). This codebase demonstrates the latest practices and coding conventions of React Hooks and functional component development.

## Demo

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/abe80f16-7981-4a03-8b82-01514e1f7f85/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/the-rickandmorty/deploys)

## Remarks
1. Whole list of R&M characters
2. Pagination and character search (by name, for now)
3. Mobile responsiveness for UI
4. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for query parameters
5. Unit/integration tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## Rooms for improvement? Definitely.
Do you see anything awkward or unreasonable? I am humbled. Looking forward to your feedback.
